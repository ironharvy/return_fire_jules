- Primary: PC (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Secondary: Modern Consoles (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch) - to be evaluated based on development resources and market opportunities.

## 3. Gameplay

### 3.1. Game Objective
The primary objective in "Return Fire Clone" is to capture the enemy's flag and bring it back to the player's home base. This typically involves:
- Infiltrating the enemy's territory.
- Locating and picking up the enemy flag (usually only possible with a specific vehicle, e.g., the Jeep).
- Evading or destroying enemy defenses and vehicles.
- Safely returning the flag to the player's designated capture point.
- The first team to successfully capture a predetermined number of flags (or the most flags within a time limit) wins the match.

### 3.2. Playable Vehicles
The game will feature four core specialized vehicles, each with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses:

#### 3.2.1. Helicopter
- **Abilities:**
    - Flight: Can traverse any terrain, including water and obstacles.
    - Strafe: Can move sideways while firing, allowing for agile attacks.
    - Mine Destruction: Capable of destroying enemy landmines from above.
    - Bridge Destruction: Can destroy certain bridges to alter pathways.
- **Armament:** Typically machine guns or light rockets.
- **Weaknesses:** Fragile; low armor. Cannot resupply fuel/ammo in the field; must return to base.
- **Strategic Use:** Reconnaissance, quick strikes, flag escort, bypassing ground defenses.

#### 3.2.2. Tank (e.g., M60)
- **Abilities:**
    - Heavy Armor: Can withstand significant damage.
    - 360Â° Rotating Turret: Can fire in any direction independently of movement.
    - Powerful Cannon: Deals high damage to vehicles and structures.
- **Armament:** Main cannon and possibly a coaxial machine gun.
- **Weaknesses:** Slow movement speed. Vulnerable to air attacks and specialized anti-tank weaponry.
- **Strategic Use:** Spearheading assaults, base defense, destroying heavily armored targets.

#### 3.2.3. Armored Support Vehicle (ASV - e.g., M270 MLRS)
- **Abilities:**
    - Most Durable: Highest armor rating among playable vehicles.
    - Mine Laying: Can deploy landmines to create defensive perimeters or traps.
    - Long-Range Artillery: Equipped with rockets or missiles for indirect fire support.
- **Armament:** Rocket/Missile launcher, deployable mines.
- **Weaknesses:** Slowest moving vehicle. Minimum engagement range for main weapons may apply.
- **Strategic Use:** Base defense, area denial, long-range bombardment, creating chokepoints.

#### 3.2.4. Jeep (e.g., M151 MUTT / HMMWV)
- **Abilities:**
    - Flag Capture: The *only* vehicle capable of picking up, carrying, and dropping the flag.
    - High Speed: Fastest land vehicle, allowing for quick flag grabs and escapes.
    - Water Traversal: Can over-inflate tires (or similar mechanic) to travel across deep water.
- **Armament:** Light machine gun (if any).
- **Weaknesses:** Extremely fragile; destroyed with minimal damage. Limited combat capability.
- **Strategic Use:** Flag running, scouting, distracting enemy units.

### 3.3. Fuel and Ammunition
- All vehicles consume fuel for movement and ammunition for their weapons.
- Limited Capacity: Each vehicle has a finite amount of fuel and ammo.
- Resupply:
    - Fuel and ammo can be replenished by driving over designated resupply points (e.g., fuel depots, ammo tents) scattered across the map.
    - Helicopters must return to their home base to resupply.
- Running out of fuel will cause a land vehicle to stop, and the driver will abandon it (visual effect, driver flees). The abandoned vehicle may be recoverable or self-destruct after a short period.

### 3.4. Enemy AI and Defenses (Single-Player / Base Defenses)
- **Automated Turrets:** Stationary defensive structures (e.g., missile turrets) that automatically engage hostile vehicles within range.
- **Drones/Patrol Vehicles:** AI-controlled units that patrol specific areas or guard key locations.
- **Boundary Submarine:** If a player attempts to go outside the defined map boundaries (especially over water), a submarine may emerge and launch a powerful, heat-seeking missile as a deterrent.
- **Mines:** AI (and players in the ASV) can deploy mines that detonate when a land vehicle drives over them.

### 3.5. Game Modes
#### 3.5.1. Single-Player Campaign
- A series of missions with increasing difficulty.
- Objectives may vary beyond simple flag capture (e.g., destroy specific targets, defend a base, timed challenges).
- Will introduce players to different vehicles and game mechanics.

#### 3.5.2. Multiplayer
- **Classic Capture the Flag:** Teams compete to capture the enemy flag and return it to their base.
- **Customizable Matches:** Options to set flag count, time limits, vehicle availability, map selection.
- Support for various player counts (e.g., 1v1, 2v2, up to a defined maximum like 4v4 or higher).
- Potential for ranked and unranked playlists.

## 4. Art and Audio

### 4.1. Visual Style
- **Perspective:** 3D bird's-eye view (top-down with a slight angle) similar to the original, allowing for a clear view of the battlefield and strategic vehicle maneuvering.
- **Graphics:** Modernized 3D graphics with detailed vehicle models, destructible environments (e.g., buildings, bridges, trees), and visually distinct terrain types (desert, forest, snow, etc.).
- **Atmosphere:** While a combat game, it should retain a slightly stylized and not overly gritty feel, with satisfying explosions and visual feedback for actions.
- **UI/UX:** Clean and intuitive User Interface. Minimap should clearly display objectives, teammates, known enemies, and resupply points. Vehicle status (health, fuel, ammo) should be easily visible.

### 4.2. Audio Design
- **Sound Effects:** Distinct and impactful sound effects for vehicle engines, weapon fire (machine guns, cannons, missiles, mines), explosions, vehicle destruction, and environmental interactions.
- **Music:**
    - A key feature will be the use of **public domain classical music**, thematically linked to specific vehicles or gameplay moments, paying homage to the original "Return Fire". Examples:
        - Helicopter: "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner.
        - Jeep: "Flight of the Bumblebee" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.
        - Tank: "Mars, the Bringer of War" from "The Planets" by Gustav Holst.
        - ASV: "In the Hall of the Mountain King" by Edvard Grieg.
        - Flag Carry: "William Tell Overture" by Gioachino Rossini.
        - Main Theme/Menu: "Dies Irae" (Verdi's Requiem) or similar dramatic classical piece.
    - Music should dynamically adapt to gameplay intensity where appropriate.
- **Voice Overs:** Minimalistic. Potential for brief vehicle callouts or objective status updates. The original game featured humorous driver screams when vehicles were destroyed, which could be considered.
